# HangmanGUI
Interactive game of hangman

Creates a GUI that allows the user to play a game of hangman. It selects a word from a database of words and 
prints empty spaces on the screen so the user can guess them.

I wrote this program during the fall of my freshman year in CS202 Computer Science II.
